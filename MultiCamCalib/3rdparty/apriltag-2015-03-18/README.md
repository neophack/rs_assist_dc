- format
  - the code only supports .pnm format, there is work to be done to support our data
  - http://ziin.pl/en/utilities/convert to manually convert
- set
  - we are using 36h11 (recommended)
  - marker pdf is checked in (need upsample image if we want more patterns)
- sample usage
  - ./apriltag_demo -f tag36h11 ./testapril_3.pnm
  - we can now run and identify the marker, but the results need to be parsed
  - the results have to be transferred into OpenCV usable format
- others
  - https://github.com/swatbotics/apriltags-cpp cpp version, need check
